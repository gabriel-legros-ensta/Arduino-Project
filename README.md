# Drone Bicopter - Position Control System

## Introduction
The focus of this project is to optimize the control system of a delivery drone to ensure the stability of its roll axis during transport operations. In particular, the challenge lies in maintaining the drone's balance while it carries cargo, preventing excessive rotation or tilting, which could jeopardize the stability and effectiveness of the delivery process.

## Problem Statement
How can the position control system of a delivery drone be optimized to ensure stable rotation around its roll axis during transport?

## Objectives of the TIPE
- Design and build a **bicopter drone** (dual-motor) with dimensions suitable for carrying small cargo.
- Write an **Arduino program** to implement **position control** of the drone's roll axis.
- Conduct a **dynamic study** of the drone to understand its behavior and improve stability.
- Study a **speed control loop** on a laboratory drone to compare and validate the position control results.

## Project Structure
- **Arduino code**: Includes the full implementation of the position control system.
- **Dynamic analysis**: Files and documents related to the study of the drone's movement.
- **Control loop**: Implementation of a speed control loop for comparative purposes.
- **Results**: Reports, graphs, and data from testing the drone's stability.
